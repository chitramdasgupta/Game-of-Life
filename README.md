This is my implementation of John Conway's [Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

To be to able to compile and run, you need to have **SDL2** installed on your system. To install SDL2, 
check [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation).

# Compile and run

```
make
./main
```
