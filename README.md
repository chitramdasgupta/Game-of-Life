Simply double click on *main.exe* to run the program.

# Unix-based systems

Simply double click on *main* to run the program.

# Compile

If you want to compile the program for yourself, you can do the following:

**NOTE:** To be able to compile on Windows you need to have [MinGW](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/releases/)
installed on your Windows system.

```
make clean
make
```
